# Garima

The idea is to produce a font based on the Ethiopic script as it appears in its earliest form found in the "Garima Gospels" manuscripts (5th - 6th century).  The manuscripts are in the Ge'ez language and would have around 254 glyphs.
The font must cover the content of the manuscripts so that they can be reproduced as text while maintaining their visual aesthetic. The font would be open source (OFL) and of primary interest to the manuscript research community.  
Font enthusiasts might also like the unique style, but there would be a severe limitation in using it for modern languages; Black[Foundry] wants to produce a commercial version that covers the full Ethiopic inventory in Unicode 14 and pair the Ethiopic typeface with a Latin companion.
